Agile Methodology:
Agile is a task workflow process used in projects to ensure that the project meets the required objectives through a clear and smooth plan. This approach facilitates teamwork and aims to achieve:

Flexibility in work

Continuous development

Faster performance

Agile vs. Waterfall:
Agile:
Typically used in projects that require continuous development and need to go through phases multiple times (moving back and forth).

Advantages:

Flexibility in work, allowing for frequent changes

Continuous development

Disadvantages:

Due to constant changes, it is difficult to determine the exact budget and time required to complete the project

Best Practices:

Ongoing discussions about the project

Working in short sprints

Waterfall:

Easier to estimate the required budget and time for the project

Clear steps for each phase

Suitable for projects that do not require continuous development

Disadvantages:

Difficult to handle changes after a phase is completed

Issues may be discovered late in the project lifecycle

Best Practices:

Clear understanding of ideas and requirements

Tracking and recording completed tasks
